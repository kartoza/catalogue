  <p><b>SANSA Earth Observation &amp; SANSA Space Operations </b> are key 
  components of SANSA's efforts to maximise the benefit of
  information, communications and space technology for industry and society. 
  SANSA Space Operations at Hartebeeshoek is located some 70 km west of 
  Pretoria in the Magaliesberg mountain range and is ideally positioned to 
  provide tracking, telemetry and command (TT&amp;C) services for 
  geo-synchronous and polar orbiting spacecraft to the manufacturers, operators 
  and users of satellites and launch vehicles. It is also ideally situated for 
  satellite data acquisition and as such, delivers world-class earth observation
  data relayed from satellites to a range of stakeholders.

  <p>
  <b>SANSA Earth Observation</b> is located at Hartebeeshoek and drives and 
  coordinates
  space based earth observation activities to sustainably benefit all South
