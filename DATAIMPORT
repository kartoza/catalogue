  1. Introduction
  ===============

Note: This document should be considered compulsory reading before you
attempt to import any data into the catalogue.

Note2: This document must be kept up to date when you make changes to
import scripts etc.

The catalogue system provides search access to metadata describing acquisitions 
that have taken place from a variety of sensors. This metadata needs to be
lodged in the database in one way or another. Different sensors have different
entry points into the system - and this document tries to cover the various
permutations and procedures for lodging data into the database.

	1.3. Sumbandilasat
	==================

For sumbandilasat the procedure for import at the moment boils down to this:

- Wolfgang / other SAC staffer performs initial L1Ab processing of imagery
- Products are placed on the SAC storage array and an email is sent to Tim 
  detailing the names of the new product directories.
- The products are copied over to LION into
  `/mnt/cataloguestorage/imagery_processing/sumbandilasat`
- The .shp project file is then imported into the sac database in the import
  schema to the 'sumb' table
- The scripts/sort_sumb_imagery.py script is then run. This converts the sumb
  pix images to tif and then files them under imagery master copies in the L1Ab
  folder as shown below.

  ├── C2B      <-- CBERS
  │   ├── 1Aa
  │   └── 1Ab
  ├── S-C      <-- SACC
  │   └── 1Ab
  └── ZA2      <-- sumbandilasat
      ├── 1Aa
      └── 1Ab

 - The scripts/sort_sumb_raw_imagery.py script is then run. This archives the
   raw folder and files it into the L1Aa folder as shown above.
