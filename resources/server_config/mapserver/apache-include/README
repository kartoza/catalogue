This is used to include all our map file directives in apache and still have
them managed in GIT. To use, add a line like this to your apache configuration:

```
Include /opt/webmapping/apache-include/mapserver.conf
```

After editing mapserver you should test apache:

```
sudo apache2ctl -t
```

It the test passes, reload it:

```
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload
```
