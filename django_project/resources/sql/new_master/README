Gavin's notes 26 May 2016

I restored a dump of sac_live:

no globals available so I added role 'timlinux' since all objects owned by him. 
createdb sac_live
psql -c 'CREATE EXTENSION postgis;' -d sac_live
/usr/share/postgresql/9.5/contrib/postgis-2.2/postgis_restore.pl -v /data/projects/SANSA/sac_live.dmp | psql sac_live

Then ran each bash script in order. 

003 had an error that I fixed in the same commit that added this file. 

008 removes all spot products with the expectation that they will be re-ingested!
