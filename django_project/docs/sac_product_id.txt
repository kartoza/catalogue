Spot 1-4 : Sensor = HRV,
           MOD = XI (four bands) XS (three bands)
           TYP = satelliteSensorNumber
Spot 5   : Sensor = HRG,
           MOD = X or A (pan 5m) or B (pan 5m) or J (4 band) or T (pan 2.5m)   
           Note: l3 products may give composite MOD e.g. JT
           TYP = satelliteSensorNumber
@note: in orbit data that has not been georeferenced will have a
           PROJTN = ORBIT 
@note: mode examples:
           J = Multispectral 10m 
           P/M = Panchromatic 10m 
           A/B = Panchromatic 5m 
           T = Panchromatic 2.5m 
           X = Multispectral 20m
           JT = Pansharpened 2.5m Multispectral
