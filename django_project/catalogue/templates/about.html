SANSA Space Operations at Hartebeeshoek is located some 70 km west of Pretoria in the Magaliesberg mountain range and is ideally positioned to provide tracking, telemetry and command (TT&C) services for geo-synchronous and polar orbiting spacecraft to the manufacturers, operators and users of satellites and launch vehicles. It is also ideally situated for satellite data acquisition and as such, delivers world-class earth observation data relayed from satellites to a range of stakeholders. </p>
