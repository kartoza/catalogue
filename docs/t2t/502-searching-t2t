An advanced search for optical products allows the user to create a refined
subset of OpticalProduct records based on various properties.
The options selected in the advanced search form are cumulative.

In the wireframe above, you can see the options available in advanced search. Some things should be noted:

- When selecting one or more missions, the sensors, modes, types and bands
  entries will be filtered to show only those items permissible for the given
  missions.
- When selecting one or more sensors, the modes, types and bands entries will
  be filtered to show only those items permissible for the given sensors.
- When selecting one or more types, the mode and band entries will be filtered
  to show only those items permissible for the given types.
- When selecting one or more modes, the band entries will be filtered to show
  only those items permissible for the given modes.
- Images with NULL cloud_cover  will be assumed to have 100% cloud cover for purposes of filtering.
- Images with NULL sensor_viewing_angle will be assumed to be excluded when filtering by sensor viewing angle.
- 

The specification of row and path ranges can be one in one of three ways:
+ A range e.g. [0,15] means include all rows/paths inclusively from 0 to 15.
+ A list e.g. 1,5,3 means include specifically row or paths numbered 1, 5 and 3.
+ A single item e.g. 10 means include only that row/path
+
