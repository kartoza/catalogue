This section covers the logic and schema related to search. The search process begins when the user clicks 'Search' on the main application toolbar. They have the option then of performing a simple search or an advanced search. Regardless of which search type they use, the outcome is the same - the catalogue application internally creates a collection of unserialised **SearchRecord** objects. These objects are simple mappings between a search and the products that match the criteria of that search.

The matching search records are shown to the user as a paginated table of entries, each entry corresponding to one product. If a user chooses to add that product to their basket, the SearchRecord is then serialised (saved persistently in the database). By definition, the basket can be defined as //"all serialised **SearchRecords** for a given user which have **no** Order associated with them"//. In the ordering section we describe the order process in more detail.
