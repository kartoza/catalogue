= 1.2 WP 3100: User Interface Design =
== 1.2.1 Requirements: ==

The following are requirements for the Catalogue User Interface:

1. All added functionality should be done on the Advanced search panel.

**TEST 3100 1. Has the basic search Panel been changed or added functionality**
**only been applied to the Advanced Search Panel?**

**Response:** Yes, no added functionality was added to the basic search panel.
Due to underlying changes to the internal application model, and to changes to
the user interface required elsewhere in this workpackage, there were some
layout changes required to the 'Basic Search' panel and the cloud cover
selector is now only available in the Advanced search panel. However the core
functionality is preserved and the basic search continues to work as before.


2. The advanced search panel should allow the user to select a dropdown menu
underneath the map canvas resize the map canvas too resolutions of: 256 x 256,
400 x 400, 600 x 400, 640 x 480, 800 x 600, 800 x 600, 1024 x 768, 1600 x 1200.
A resolution of 800 x 600 should be the default. A similar functionality as
provided by https://zulu.ssc.nasa.gov/mrsid/mrsid.pl is thought after.

**TEST 3100 2. Does the Map canvas allow dynamic resizing?**

**Response:** Yes. The map can be dynamically resized to fit the available screen
area. No fixed sizes are used, rather the size adapts to the display which
provides a better user experience.

3. Tool tips should be provided for each tool on the map canvas. The layer
selection tool for the map canvas should be more pronounced. A user should get
the option to upload either a shape file or a KML file to deliniate his AOI. In
addition a user should be able to provide bounding box coordinates or a
circular radius for a central AOI possition.

**TEST 3100 3.1 Are Tool tips provided for each tool on the map canvas?**

**Response:** Yes, tooltips are now provided for each mapcanvas tool.

**TEST 3100 3.2 Is the Layer selection tool for the map canvas more pronounced**
**than in the previous Catalogue version?**

**Response:** Yes, the layer selector has been marked 'LAYERS' instead of a
simple '+' symbol.

**TEST 3100 3.3 Is the functionality provided for a user to upload a shape file** 
**to deliniate his AOI?**

**Response:** Yes the user is able to do this.

**TEST 3100 3.4 Is the functionality provided for a user to upload a KML file
to deliniate his AOI?**

**Response:** Yes the user is able to do this.

**TEST 3100 3.5 Is the interface provided for a user to define bounding box
coordinates to select his AOI?**

**Response:** Yes the user is able to do this.

**TEST 3100 3.6 Is the interface provided for a user to define centre and
radius coordinates to select his AOI?**

**Response:** Yes the user is able to do this.

4. The Mr Sid Earthsat Mosaic provided by SAC should be used as base for the
global backdrop on the map canvas. For South Africa the latest Spot 5 mosaic
should be used. SAC will provide the global Earthsat Mosaic at a ground
resolution of 90 m reprojected to Geographic and a 15m product in tiles in
MrSid format in UTM North projection. 

**TEST 3100 4.1 Has the MrSid Earthsat Mosaic been added as additional layer to
the map canvas for the world?**

**Response:** This is still in progress due to technical issues encountered.

** TEST 3100 4.2 Has the latest Spot 5 mosaic been added as default backdrop on
the map canvas for South Africa?**

**Response:** This will be completed when the above dependency has been met.

5. Users should be requested to select the product types they are searching
for, starting with a choice of either, Satellite Imagery (L1-3), or
Geoinformation Products ( Satellite imagery derived L4).

**TEST 3100 5.1 Are users prompted to select the product types they would like
to search, discriminating between Satellite Imagery or Geoinformation
Products?**

**Response:** Yes. As per discussions with the client, the models have been
updated and also now include Generic Imagery products (for derived raster
products where the originating sensor is not clearly defined).

When Selecting Satellite Imagery, they need to be presented of a choice for
SAR or Optical data. (mandatory)

**TEST 3100 5.2 Are users required to select between optical or radar satellite
imagery before continuing with other fields?**

**Response:** Yes, users can choose between Optical and Radar products for
sensor based searches. The sensor lists are filtered accordingly.

When choosing Optical Data, they need to be presented with options spatial
resolution ranges from <1m, 1m - 7m, 7m - 25m, 25m - 70m, 70m - 1km, > 1km or
alternatively they may choose the spatial resolution range themselves.
(mandatory)

**TEST 3100 5.3 Are users required to select between different spatial
resolutions before being able to advance the search?**

**Response:** Yes, the user can choose from a spatial resolutions list as
defined above. Due to the paucity of appropriate data for some products,
triggers have been implemented to populate this data automatically for know
datasources when they are added if this data is not explicitly defined.

**TEST  3100 5.4 Can users select multiple resolutions to enable a wider
search? **

**Response:** Yes.

**TEST  3100 5.4 Are the following resolution ranges from <1m, 1m - 7m, 7m -
25m, 25m - 70m, 70m - 1km, > 1km provided to the user?**

**Response:** Yes.

After choosing the resolution range for optical data, users need to choose
the spectral resolution ranging from panchromatic, true colour (3 bands RGB),
multispectral (4 - 8 bands), superspectral (9 - 40 bands) and hyperspectral (>
41 bands).(optional)

**TEST  3100 5.5 Have users got the option to select spectral resolution with
the following ranges: Panchromatic, true colour (3 bands RGB), multispectral (4
- 8 bands), superspectral (9 - 40 bands) and hyperspectral (> 41 bands)? Here
the "SENSOR_TYPE_ABBREVIATION" or "TYPE_NAME" fields out of the Sensor Model
spreadsheet would be preferred. **

**Response:**

License type. Free data, government license or commercial license or any.

**TEST  3100 5.6 Can a user select to query data by license types:  Free data,
government license or commercial license or any?**

**Response:**

Define the allowable percentage cloud cover. (optional)

**TEST  3100 5.7 Can a user select the maximum allowable percentage cloud
cover?**

**Response:** Yes the user can select the cloud cover percentage for their
searches. Note that not all products have cloud cover data associated with
them.

Define the allowable acquisition angle range. (optional)

**TEST  3100 5.8 Can a user define the allowable acquisition angle range?**

**Response:** Yes the acquisition angle range can be optianlly selected.

A refinement of search criteria for SAR imagery based on resolution
wavelength and polarisation will not be implemented at this stage. (Refinement
is possible by the definition of the SAC ID elements).

**TEST  3100 5.9 Can a user refine his search for SAR imagery based on the SAC
ID elements?**

**Response:** All searches can be refined following the initial search using
the 'Modify search' button provided on the search results page.

Users then need to be able to refine the search criteria further by selecting
elements that make up a SAC scene ID. Any elements can also be left blank
interpreted as wild card (all fields optional). Only elements appropiate for
criteria defined previously should be shown in drop down menu's allowing
multiple selections. Selections should be first made on the:

**TEST  3100 5.10 Are only SAC ID elements appropriate for products fulfilling
previously set requirements available for selection as SAC ID elements?**

**Response:** All searches can be refined following the initial search using
the 'Modify search' button provided on the search results page.
 
 Satellite Mission 

**TEST  3100 5.10 Can Users select multiple Satellite Missions ?**

**Response:** We have implemented drop down menus (as specified above). Note
that drop down menus only support /  only allow single selections. 

Sensor (Only relevant to Satellite Missions selected previously)

**TEST  3100 5.11 Can Users select multiple Sensors ?**

**Response:** Yes. Only sensors relevant to the selected mission (if any) can
be selected.

least one date range is required.


Available processing levels.

**TEST  3100 5.22 Can Users select multiple processing levels appropriate for a
certain SAC_ID configuration or product type ?**

**Response:** The test above adds requirements that were not in the original
specification. As per the original specification, the user can specify
processing levels. Adding constraints to the processing levels list will need
to be implemented in a future work package.

6. After Executing a Query, users need to be able to see the found records in
a table containing the following fields: SAC Scene ID, Cloud Cover Percentage,
Metadata, Add record to shopping basket and the thumbnail. When viewing the
metadata per record an option should be provided in the single scene metadata
view window, to save the metadata as HTML file, or to download the record as an
ISO file.

**TEST  3100 6.1 Are the following fields displayed in tabular fashion to a
user for found records after a search:  SAC Scene ID, Cloud Cover Percentage,
Metadata, Add record to shopping basket and the thumbnail?**

**Response:** Yes.

**Response:** Yes.

**TEST  3100 6.3 Can this metadata be saved as HTML file?**

**Response:**

**TEST  3100 6.4 Can this metadata be saved as ISO compliant XML file?**

**Response:**



7. After executing a query, the user should be able to select records for
further interrogation before adding them to his shopping basket to refine the
search allowing him to eliminate for instance all cloudy scenes. From this
refined search users should be able to download all metadata for records in a
boundle as KML file, ESRI Shape file containing only SARMES report fields, or
as ISO XML files, including the thumbnails with world files. The same boundled
Metadata download functionality should be provided for records put into the
shopping basket.

**TEST  3100 7.1 Can users further refine the search after a query or
interrogate records further before adding them to a shopping basket?**

**Response:** Yes.

**TEST  3100 7.2 Can users download metadata of products selected in a boundle

**TEST  3100 7.3 Can users download metadata of products selected in a boundle
as ESRI Shape file file  including the thumbnails with world files?**

**Response:**

**TEST  3100 7.4 Can users download metadata of products selected in a boundle
as ESRI Shape file containing only SARMES report fields including the
thumbnails with world files?**

**Response:**

**TEST  3100 7.5 Can users download metadata of products selected in a boundle
as ISO XML files the thumbnails with world files?**

**Response:** 


8. The order form should provide fields that are applicable and relevant for
the products to be ordered only. 

**TEST  3100 8.1 Are only fields applicable to ordered products provided on the
order form?**

**Response:** We have implemented global order options and per-product detailed
options. The user this has fine-grained control over the order specification.

A "notes" section should be provided allowing users to enter special
requests.

**TEST  3100 8.2 Is a notes section provided to users to enter special requests
in the order form?**

**Response:** Yes. A notes area is provided for this purpose.

Selection on the required file format should be provided.

**TEST  3100 8.3 Is a selection of the required file format provided in the
order form per product?**

**Response:** Yes. File format can be specified on a per-product basis or for
the order as a whole.

Selection on the required Processing level should be provided (product
specific)

**TEST  3100 8.4 Is a product specific and relevant selection of the processing
level provided to the user in the order form?**

**Response:** Yes. Processing levels can be assigned per product or specified
at the order level (for the order as a whole).

Selection on the required Projection should be provided (Only projections
that make sense for the relevant product should be made available for
selection) 

**TEST  3100 8.5 Can a user select a relevant and applicable Projection for the
product being limited to those that are sensible for the product?**

**Response:** Yes. The projection list is constrained to the UTM zones covered
by the product centers, plus one zone each to the left and right. Additionally
EPSG:4326 and EPSG:900913 CRS's are provided as standard.

Provision should be made to select a appropriate resampling algorithm. 

**TEST  3100 8.6 Can a user select only the appropriate resampling algorithm
for the product in the order menu?**

**Response:** Yes. Note that the user needs to select the appropriate
resampling algorithm from the list of resampling algs (the wording in the test
above implies different functionality to the original specification - the
original specification was used).

}}The user should have the option to select that he wants imagery for the AOI
only. In that case imagery will be clipped to the AOI and the area of imagery
with values calculated for that AOI. Where clients order a L3B product the area
of the AOI only needs to be calculated for billing. In that case the client
needs to selects members of mosaics if several mosaics should be created for
the same AOI for a time series. (This is complicated and the feasibility needs
to be discussed with Linfiniti)

**TEST  3100 8.7 Is the user provided with the option to get imagery clipped to
his AOI only?**

**Response:** Yes. During the order process, the use can specify an AOI which 
is made available to operators to use for the clip operation.

**TEST  3100 8.8 Is the area for the AOI calculated for billing purposes.**

**Response:** Yes the area is calculated and shown on the order report.

**TEST  3100 8.9 Has the client got the ability to select the elements that
need to enter a mosaic in the case where several mosaics should be generated
for time series analysis?**

**Response:** As mentioned in the spec, this requirement was a soft
requirement. We have implemented as part of this work package support for
creating DAG (directed acyclical graphs) of products (to show product
interdependencies. We have also refactored the product models, one of the
results of which is the new GenericImageryProduct which can be a composite of
multiple products. Based on discussions with the client, the need for further
scoping analysis and the short project timeframe, mechanisms for defining
mosaics, adding logic for checking if the products in an order are a valid set
for a mosaic and so on have not yet been implemented and shall remain topics 
for a future work package. The refactoring we have done to the product models 
paves the way for this improvement in the future.


= 1.3 WP 3200: Functionality Improvement and Training =
== 1.3.1 Requirements: ==
Contract with Linfiniti Consulting for the execution of the project with
deliverables and payments defined per work package.

The new catalogue should have the following functionality requirements:
1. DIMS package ingestion
The ability to harvest metadata from all packages generated by DIMS EODC and
placed on a pick up point in the DMZ. This metadata harvesting and catalogue
updating should happen once a day, triggered by a cron job.
The same metadata package should be made available for download to users at
the respective place of the catalogue User Interface mentioned in WP3100.

generated by DIMS and coordinate further communication to the client and SAC
staff between DIMS and the catalogue. (Ensure that sufficient communication
takes place)

**TEST  3200 2.2  Are order notifications for for non-free or products that
need to be generated by DIMS and coordinate further communication to the client
and SAC staff between DIMS and the catalogue provided automatically to clients
and SAC staff?**

**Response:**

3. Send summary email monthly of all orders, order progress, ordered product
type stats and catalogue queries stats on country, client type, product type
and area hotspots.

**TEST  3200 2.3 Are summary emails generated monthly automatically of all
orders, order progress, ordered product type stats and catalogue queries stats
on country, client type, product type and area hotspots to SANSA EOC customer
services and management?**

**Response:**

The following sensors should be supported in addition to the current
collection:
1. TerraSAR-X The catalogue needs to harvest the TerraSAR-X archive to go
from http://terrasar-x-archive.infoterra.de/# at regular intervals and update
records. (AOI Southern Africa)

**TEST  3200 3.1 Does the catalogue support TerraSAR-X and gets regularly
updated for new acquisitions in Southern Africa? **

**Response:** Yes this has been implemented and a complete run carried out.

XXXX Cron Job Check Needed XXXX

}}2. RapidEye has provided SAC access to their archive records and given
permission to add these to SAC's own catalogue. All records for Southern Africa
(South of the Equator) need to be added to the catalogue and preferably updated
at daily intervals. The following particulars have been provided by RapidEye to
make this possible.
Your username is: c_0010027
Your password is: 8u3j8csPpI
our Download Catalog as well as to our Online Discovery Tool EyeFind. You may
access here: https://eyefind.rapideye.de Download Catalog can be found here:
https://delivery.rapideye.de/catalogue/

**TEST  3200 3.2 Does the catalogue support rapidEye and gets regularly updated
for new acquisitions in Southern Africa?**

**Response:** Yes an ingestor for RE itt data has been implemented.

XXXX Cron Job Check Needed XXXX

3. MODIS data is received by SAC daily and these images need to be published
on our catalogue and made available for free download as presently provided for
SAC-C and Sumbandilasat. All products can be found on the cxfs under
/cxfs/datapickup/modis/ 
}}Users should be able to query the full swath products using the thumbnails
from /cxfs/datapickup/modis/truecolour_swath/thumbnail and the metadata from
/cxfs/datapickup/modis/level-1b, as well as the gridded products using metadata
from /cxfs/datapickup/modis/mod09_comp and thumbnails to be produced from the
same dataset. Users should be able to order all the provided MODIS
products/processing levels, but need to define these in the order page.

**TEST  3200 3.3 Does the catalogue support MODIS and gets regularly updated
for new acquisitions in Southern Africa?**

**Response:** Modis ingestion is supported. A test run of several hundred
scenes has been performed on the test environment. When the system in this work
package 'go live' support is implemented for regular updates via a django
command task. It should be anticipated that the complete ingestion of the back
catalogue will take several weeks depending on network bandwidth.

}}4. MISR data was delivered to SAC by NASA and now has to be served to the
user community free of charge via the catalogue. Imagery has been provided in
L1B terrain corrected and Earth corrected full swath products. Data can be
found under /cxfs/datapickup/misr. Metadata and thumbnails need to be extracted
from the L1BT hdf files only. 

**TEST  3200 3.4 Does the catalogue support MERIS and gets regularly updated
for new acquisitions in Southern Africa?**

**Response:** MISR data ingestion is supported. A test run has been made in the 
test environment and where data are without issues they import successfully.
Once the system is deployed live a full run will be carried out. This can also
be expected to take days / weeks. Any issues that may arise will need to be
resolved as part of our standard support services.

= 1.4 WP 3300: OGC Enablement =
== 1.4.1 Requirements: ==
The following OGC related functionality is required for the catalogue:
1. DIMS order handling
}}DIMS provides some OGC services such as order handling to which the catalogue
should interface to. A order should be sent from the Catalogue to DIMS,
triggering the extraction, processing and delivery of products by DIMS.
Sufficient email notification on the order status should be ensured either by
DIMS or the catalogue.

**TEST  3300 1.1 Is it possible to submit an order to DIMS via the Catalogue
which triggers the  extraction, processing and delivery of products by DIMS?**

**Response:** Yes. However there are issues. In particular there is not a
indexable product reference that can be used in order to canonically refer to a
DIMS product given a SAC product ID. We have written all the code needed for
this and when these issues are resolved on DIMS we will be able to enter it
into the production environment. Most likely some additional work will be
needed to test and deploy this code properly.

**TEST  3300 1.2 Does a order that passes through the catalogue to DIMS trigger
sufficient email notifications so that both customer services and the client
are continiously informed of the order status?**

**Response:** All orders placed on the catalogue trigger an email to the client
and SANSA customer services. As mentioned above, there is not yet a usable
mechanism for interacting with DIMS due to some issues with the implementation
of the DIMS OGC ordering service implementation.

2. CSW support
DIMS will provide CSW support by the beginning of March. It would be great if
the catalogue could function as client for this CSW service.

**TEST  3300 2. Does the catalogue function as client for the DIMS CSW?**

**Response:** This functionality was not available in DIMS at the conclusion of
this contract. The use of the catalogue as a client to DIMS via an OGC CSW
service will need to be revisited at a future time.


= 1.5 WP 3400: Metadata Preparation Tool =
== 1.5.1 Requirements: ==
To provide a tool that prepares metadata according to ISO standards for any
given geographic dataset in vector or raster format using templates for data
types, licenses, institutional profiles, user profiles, workflows and allowing
the ingestion of log files for the automatic population of fields.

**Response:**

**TEST  3400 1. Does the metadata preparation tool work with raster and vector
data?**

**Response:** Yes, the metadata tool works with file based raster and vector data.

**TEST  3400 2. Does the metadata preparation tool generate metadata XML files
according to ISO standards?**

**Response:** Yes. The tool creates ISO 19115  SANSA profile v1 compliant XML.
Please note that there are numerous issues with the SANSA profile and that the
profile should be revised and a V2 edition published which addresses these
issues. In particular the revised profile should:

- be 100% compliant to the ISO19115 spec.
- be accompanied by an XSL schema document for automated validation of compliant documents.
- include all needed fields to cover the core fields defined in the catalogue
  v2 product models for GenericProduct, OpticalProduct, RadarProduct,
  GeospatialProduct etc.

**TEST  3400 3. Does the metadata preparation tool provide the possibility to
generate templates for different data types, consisting of vector data,
thematic raster, continious raster and imagery, allowing the description of
data in terms of spatial accuracy, thematic content, thematic accuracy and
spatial scale?**

**Response:** Yes the tool includes a template creation and selection of
different datatypes.

**Test 3400 4.  Does the metadata preparation tool provide the possibility to
generate templates for different licenses?**

**Response:** Yes templates for diferent licenses can be created.

**Test 3400 5.  Does the metadata preparation tool provide the possibility to
generate templates for different institutional profiles?**

**Response:** Yes templates for different institutional profiles can be created.

**Test 3400 6.  Does the metadata preparation tool provide the possibility to
generate templates for different user profiles (personal data of creator)?**

**Response:** Yes. This is provided within the organisational profile creation
facility.

**Test 3400 7.  Does the metadata preparation tool provide the possibility to
generate templates for different WORKFLOWS?**

**Response:** Yes different workflows consisting of workflow name and freeform
text describing the workflow can be created as templates.
