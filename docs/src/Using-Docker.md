# Catalogue on Docker

This page explains how catalogue is maintained using docker.
Shell or command line interface (CLI) is used to execute all the commands below.

## Images
All required apps have been build and packed into docker images on the server.
These images would then be executed as containers.

## Containers  
Catalogue runs on top of docker containers.
To see the list of docker containers, type: `docker ps`.

Then, a list of containers along with its images and ports are shown.

From here, you could go into a container based on the need, for example: a database container.

To go into database, type: `docker exec -it catalogue-db bash`.
Type `docker` when asking for a password.

You would be on the catalogue db container. Please note that this is not the real database, it's just a container serves as database. Type: `psql -h localhost -U docker "dbname=gis" -p 5432` to go to Postgres interactive terminal.
From here, you can type any sql commands.

If you keen to learn more about docker, you can go to [documentation page](https://docs.docker.com).
